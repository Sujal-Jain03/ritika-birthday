                        From the outside, this message might look like a love letter, but it’s not.  
                        It’s just a few little things I’ve experienced with you and wanted to put into words today.

                        At first, I used to think you were strange, selfish, picky, and honestly, I had a lot of assumptions about you.  
                        But with time, I realised you’re not like that at all. You just have your own cute and unique way of being you,  
                        and yes, you may be a little stingy sometimes, but that’s completely okay and kind of funny now. 😂

                        The biggest shift I saw in how I see you was when I found out how much you love bikes—especially the way  
                        you liked my Honda and even gave it a name: “Lal Pari”. The way you said it made it sound so precious and special. 😂😂

                        I want to keep writing, because there are so many small moments and memories with you,  
                        but I can’t seem to put everything into proper words right now.  
                        Maybe someday, I’ll write the longer version of this and make you read all of it. 🙂

                        Stay genuinely happy, keep smiling the way you do, and may God quietly fulfill the wishes you keep in your heart.
